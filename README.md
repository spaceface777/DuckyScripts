# DuckyScripts

A collection of Rubber Ducky scripts for the Digispark.
***

## Available scripts

**If you have an idea for a new script or have a problem with an existing one, please [open an issue](https://github.com/spaceface777/DuckyScripts/issues/new).**

 - **[DuckyRoll](https://github.com/spaceface777/DuckyScripts/tree/master/DuckyRoll)** - A script that opens [fakeUpdate](http://fakeupdate.net/win10u/) in full screen and plays the Rickroll song


## Project structure 
Each folder contains an individual Rubber Ducky script; that means that each folder contains: 
 - A `README.md` file, explaining more in-depth what that individual script does
 - One `.ino` file (the program uploaded to the Arduino)
 - Any dependencies the script has to download 
   - This may be a `Powershell` script, an image, or anything else required for the script to run
